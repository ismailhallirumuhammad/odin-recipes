    <h3>How to Prepare Tuwo Shinkafa and Miyan Taushe</h3>
    <p>Tuwo Shinkafa is a northern Nigerian dish. It is a thick pudding made out of local rice, millet or maze. It is usually served with soups of Northern origin. The soup may be Miyan Kuka, Miyan Kubewa or Miyan Taushe. However, for the sake of this article we will be serving our Tuwo with Miyan Taushe.</p>
    <p>Miyan Taushe is a pumpkin soup of northern origin. It is most commonly eaten among the northern people of Nigeria; the Hausas and Fulaniâ€™s.</p>
    <p>The rice used in making Tuwo Shinkafa must be the soft rice variety that becomes sticky when cooked. The soft rice variety is preferred because the grains are easily mashed into a mass of Fufu (Tuwo).This dish is particularly nutritious because of the ingredients used in making it. The vegetables provide a source of vitamin while the meat accounts for proteins. The pumpkin seeds are a good source of Magnesium, Manganese, Ion, Zinc and Copper. Again, the pumpkin seeds contain high amounts of antioxidants and are full of beneficial fats, boost immune system and help control blood sugar.</p>

    </ol>
    <p>Method</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the pumpkin in half, then cut in chunks. Peel the hard outer layer, take out the seed and the hairy pulp. You can also use canned pumpkin puree as long as it is organic. If you are using canned pumpkin, add it to the pot after the meats have cooked.</li>
        <li>Boil and season the pumpkin with the assorted meats and smoked fish.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is cooked, fry it slightly.</li>
        <li>Take out the pumpkin and mash it into tiny bite sized pieces. Once this is done, set aside.</li>
        <li>Roast the Groundnuts for 3mins in a pan. You can use already roasted and peeled groundnut.</li>
        <li>Peel off the skin of the groundnut. And then blend in a mill till the groundnut forms a paste.</li>
        <li>Blend the pepper, tomatoes and onion.</li>
        <li>Put it in a pan and boil until all the water content has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Put the fried meat back into the pot with the meat stock. Add the mashed pumpkins. Allow it to simmer.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat, add the groundnut paste and allow it dissolve into the mix.</li>
        <li>Allow to simmer for 3mins. At this point, the soup is thick and has taken on an orange color.</li>
        <li>Add the locust bean and pepper. If you desire to use palm oil, now is the time to add it. Stir gently.</li>
        <li>At this point, add the chopped spinach.</li>
        <li>Stir and allow to simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the Yakuwa leaves to the soup. Stir and allow to simmer for few minutes.</li>
